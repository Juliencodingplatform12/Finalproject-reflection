What was challenging for you during this process?
Being able to make something happen when the two objects touch
What makes more sense now than it did before you started? How Dx and Dy work also using random points and using a key to move and reset the 2 objects
What are you proud of? I am proud although it took me some time I was able to make a running code that I feel met the requirements also I really liked doing this challenge because it was hard to the level I was challenged
